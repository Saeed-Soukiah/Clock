# Digital clock in C++
Description: 
This program simulates a digital clock that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The user can:
- Initialize the clock with a specific time.
- Change the time by pressing Enter.
- Reset the clock to 00:00:00 by pressing the 'r' key.
- Exit the program by pressing the 'e' key.
The clock updates every second and includes input handling to allow time changes or resetting without interrupting the clock display.
